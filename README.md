# ESP32-PN532

PN532 (HSU) library
- Platform: ESP-IDF (e.g. ESP32)
- Can work with DESFireAES library for NXP MIFARE DESFire EV1 cards
- See include file for details of functions

Includes KiCad PCB design for PN532 based NFC reader board and 3D case designs. Unlike some NFC boards this includes three traffic light LEDs, a tamper switch, and external contacts for a door bell push, all accessable as GPIO over the HSU connection.
